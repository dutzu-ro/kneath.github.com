# The Great Warpspire Refresh of 2018

It's been a while, and it's time for a change. This is a roadmap to get my blog in a shape for the year 2018 of our Lord and Savior, the Gregorian calendar.

There isn't a specific focus for this roadmap. It's just a lot of cleanup that I've been procrastinating on and some reshuffling of the architecture to better match my current place in life.
